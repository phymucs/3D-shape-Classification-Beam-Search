Sinisa:

E.g, loss is defined using “if” statements:
- If all classes are in only one branch, then loss is 1 for all data samples.
- If there is exactly one class in either of the two branches, say class k is in the left branch, and majority of samples from class k are in the right branch, then again loss is 1 for all data samples. 
- If there is exactly one class in either of the two branches, say class k is in the left branch, and majority of samples from class k are in the left branch, then loss is 1 for all data samples of class k in the right branch. 
- Otherwise, loss is computed as we had it before.

Behrooz:
 think enforces higher level constraints. I asked him to choose the ground truth for the top 50% classes by majority vote and the other 50% of the classes with the minority vote.
